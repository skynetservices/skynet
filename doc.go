/*
SkyNet is a framework for a distributed system of processes.

Each process in SkyNet receives its configuration from a centralized configuration repository (currently Doozer - possibly pluggable in the future).
Configuration changes are pushed to each process when changes to the processes running occur.  This means that starting a new service automatically
advertises that service's availability to the rest of the processes.



Services -
	Services are where the work gets done.  These are the processes that service the requests, process the API calls, get the external data, log the requests, authenticate the users, etc.

(Optional) Watchers -
	Watchers are tasks that run and know about the system, but aren't responding to individual requests.  An example of a watcher would be a process that watches the other processes in the system.


SkyNet uses Doozer to store configuration data about the available services.  Configuration changes are pushed to Doozer, causing connected clients to immediately become aware of changed configurations.
