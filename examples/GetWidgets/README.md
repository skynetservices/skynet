# Examples
Getwidgets is an example app mesh in Skynet.  

## To get going:
* Build all apps - we use go-gb
* Start Doozer
* Start one of each app
* Profit

## Specifics

* `rand-init`/`rand-agent` is a very simple Consumer/Provider pair.
* `my-init`/`my-agent` is a simple version using special Request/Response objects.
* `router` needs to be refactored still.
